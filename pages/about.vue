            <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Phase 1: Candidate Applications</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">Various community members will be able to submit their applications within a specified time period. <br/>
                Once the application period ends, all applications are reviewed by current admin team to confirm candidate eligibility.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Phase 2:  Discussion Forums Open</h2>
            <p class="mt-4"> Each candidate is given a separate forum to present their ideas and engage with the community.<br/>
                Community members can ask questions and interact with candidates in their respective forums. <br />
                Forums remain open for discussion for a period of 5 days which overlaps with phase 3 (note: this duration can vary due to extenuating circumstances).
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Phase 3: Endorsements</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">After the discussion forms have been open for 48 hours, community members can endorse up to five candidates.<br> 
                A candidate must receive a minimum of fifteen (15) endorsements to advance to the next stage.<br />
                Each community member can only submit one (1) endorsement.

            <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Phase 4: Interviews with current Admins</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">Candidates who receive the required number of endorsements will be interviewed by the current admin team and advisors.<br />
                Interviews will be conducted in a private voice channel and will be recorded for transparency.<br />
                Interviews will be conducted over a period of three 3 days.
